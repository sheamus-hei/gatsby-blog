Industrial Engineer turned full-stack developer. With a strong technical background in manufacturing and engineering, I have experience solving a wide variety of problems. Knowledge of human factors and customer service understanding of front end user experience add to my statistical knowledge and data science research for a full stack development mindset. Experience with Javascript, Java, Python, and SQL dialects.
