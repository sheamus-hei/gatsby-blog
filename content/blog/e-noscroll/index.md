No Scroll Recipes - Are you tired of scrolling past a food bloggerâ€™s life story to get to their recipe? This app is for you. No Scroll is a micro-blogging platform for recipes that limits recipe descriptions to the length of a tweet.

Tech: MERN - MongoDB (Mongoose), Express.js, React, Node.js, CSS
